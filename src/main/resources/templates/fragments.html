            <h1>Decathlon Score Calculator</h1>
            <p>The decathlon is a combined event in athletics consisting of ten track and field events. The scoring tables for the decathlon have undergone continual evolution since their inception about a century ago, with several changes to both the character of the equations and the indices on which the equations are based.</p>
